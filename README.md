How It Works
Mark Your Visits: On the map, you can click on any location to add a pin. Each pin represents a place you’ve visited, and you can customize it by adding notes about your experience.

Take Notes: For every place you visit, you can write down thoughts, memories, or future plans. This makes WanderMap not only a tracker but also a personal travel journal.

View Your Journey: You can always go back to see where you've been. The map updates dynamically to reflect the pins you've placed, making it easy to visualize your journey across different continents.

Countries Tracker: The app will automatically track the countries you’ve visited and display them for you to admire your growing travel history.
